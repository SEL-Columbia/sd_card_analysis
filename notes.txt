troubleshooting
---------------
some of the log files have some sort of corruption that
will cause the program to crash.
when this happens make a note of the error and the last
file listed in the program output.
look at the folder containing the file and look for any
issues.

1) empty file
2) missing header line
3) malformed entry in file
